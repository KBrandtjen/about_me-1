//question 6
/* As a developer, I want to add a sixth question to my guessing game that takes numeric input by prompting a user to guess a number (for instance, "What is my favorite number?" or "How many Pok√©mon did I catch yesterday?"), and indicates to the user whether the guess is 'too high' or 'too low', and gives the user exactly four opportunities to get the correct answer, so that my fancy programming skills are showcased.*/

  for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++){
    alert('Yikes! Too high. Try again.');
    parseInt(prompt('How old is Rachael?'));
  };
};


console.log(answerSix);

console.log('Yo what\'s up');

/*As a developer, I want to add a seventh question to my guessing game that has multiple possible correct answers that are stored in an array. For instance, "Can you guess a state that I have lived in besides Washington?", so that even more of my programming skills are showcased. For now, I will structure this question so that the user has six tries to get a single correct answer, and upon using up those tries OR getting a correct answer, displays a message to the user indicating all of the possible correct answers.

As a developer, I want to keep a tally of the total number of correct answers given by the user, and at the end of the game, tell the user how well they did with a personalized custom message that includes the number of correct answers and also addresses the user by name, e.g. "You got 4 out of 7 questions correct, Bobbi! Better luck next time."

User Stories (Stretch goals... not required!)

As a developer, I want to make my code more DRY by putting all of the questions, answers, and responses to the first five yes/no questions in my guessing game into arrays (or even one huge multidimensional array), and modifying the game logic such that a 'for' loop will control the flow from question to question.
Make the number-guessing question use a random number as its correct answer.
Move the guessing game to a separate HTML file, list the questions on the page, and then have the answers fill in on the page after the user provides the answers.

Technical Requirements

Expect that you will probably need both 'for' and 'while' structures for your sixth and seventh questions. But not necessarily.
Use separate Git branches for the coding of the sixth and seventh questions, plus the coding of the tally of correct answers. Upon completion of the work in each branch, make a Pull Request to the master branch and merge the branch without deleting the branch.
